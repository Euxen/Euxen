- 👋 Hi, I’m @Euxen
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring Web Dev along with some bits of AI/3D libraries mixed in it for animations.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python as a backend and React as a frontend.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any kind of Web Dev projects.
- 📫 How to reach me, well, currently only through Github.
